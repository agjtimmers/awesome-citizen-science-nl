# Citizen Science Projects Dataset Specifications

The dataset contains citizen science projects in the Netherlands. Citizen science is scientific work that citizens completely or partially conduct themselves on a voluntary basis. Professional researchers often provide instructions and guidance, but they are not the main collectors of the data. Alongside project names, the dataset includes supplementary information regarding a description of the project, its organizers, location, duration, data accessibility, and links to the main project information and data if applicable. This document contains a technical specification of the dataset. 

## Data availability 

The list of Citizen Science projects is available in various formats. This makes the reuse 
of the dataset easy. The human-readable list of projects is available on the website 
https://sodascience.github.io/awesome-citizen-science-nl/. This list is also available on
GitHub https://github.com/sodascience/awesome-citizen-science-nl where it is 
maintained.

Structured datsets with more variables (see [Codebook](#codebook)) are available as CSV and 
Excel files on both GitHub and Zenodo. The latter one is recommended for academic use because
the releases are persistent and therefore won't change anymore (important for reproducibility).

## Data updates

The dataset on Github is updated every time a new project is proposed and merged into the 
project by the maintainers. The dataset on Zenodo is updated once in a while when new projects 
are added to the list. The version number of the dataset on Zenodo reflects the date of 
retrieval from GitHub.
